        <h4>Pair Programming and Feedback</h4>
        <h5>What's it like?</h5>
        <p id="date">May 10, 2015</p>
        <br>
        <h5>Pairing</h5><br>
        <p>According to Wikipedia, "pair programming is an agile software development technique in which two programmers work as a pair together on one workstation. One, the driver, writes code while the other, the navigator, reviews each line of code as it is typed." The observer is a sort of "safety net" or "guide." Cool! Sounds easy enough, right? I was a little anxious for my first couple pairing sessions and it was sorta like:</p><br>

        <br>
        <p>The nerves eventually went away, however, and I discovered that at the end of the day, your pair wants to get through the challenge as much as you do, and it's really okay if you don't fully grasp a concept. Your pair is there to help you, and vice versa. Nothing wrong in that! I think the most difficult aspect of pairing (remotely, anyway) involves communication. At some point or another, someone is talking over the other, or possibly overstepping their role. It's important to check in with your pair and make sure their understanding is on track. If you're not 100% comfortable with a concept, ask for your pair to slow down. Communication is key for a good pairing session. Since our partner's nonverbal communication cues are obscured by pairing remotely, it's really important to think out loud.</p><br>
        <p>Something else I have trouble with is feeling distracted. I know I work best alone, and it's been an adjustment working with others. I have a tough time concentrating with the pressure of someone being on the receiving end. Like: "I have to come up with something fast, or else I'll let my pair down."</p><br>
        <h5>Getting feedback</h5><br>
        <p>Mostly, my feedback has been really positive. It was a huge relief knowing I'm doing okay and communicating well!</p><br>

        <p>Personally, I think I should work more on explaining my thought process a little better, and perhaps not being afraid of appearing pushy when I feel really confident with a concept. If I know about something, I should feel comfortable admitting it, rather than dumbing myself down. Writing feedback for the pairs I didn't have stellar sessions with was difficult. How do you criticize someone kindly? I keep in mind, the criticism is for their own good. In this process, it's all about helping others and helping others help you.</p>
