        <h4>Pair Programming and Feedback</h4>
        <h5>What's it like?</h5>
        <p id="date">May 10, 2015</p>
        <br>
        <h5>Pairing</h5><br>
        <p>According to Wikipedia, "pair programming is an agile software development technique in which two programmers work as a pair together on one workstation. One, the driver, writes code while the other, the navigator, reviews each line of code as it is typed." The observer is a sort of "safety net" or "guide." I was a little anxious for my first couple pairing sessions, not knowing whether to drive or navigate and it kinda felt like:</p><br>

        <br>
        <p>The nerves eventually went away, however, and I discovered that at the end of the day, your pair wants to get through the challenge as much as you do, and it's really okay if you don't fully grasp a concept. Your pair is there to help you, and vice versa.</p><br>
        <p>Pairing is interesting. There are some people you vibe with right away and others with whom you don't. I think as long as you're both communicating well, your session can be a good one. You don't have to see eye to eye on everything. That's not the point. Since our partner's nonverbal communication cues are obscured by pairing remotely, it's really important to communicate well: speak up when you're not understanding something, and/or continue to check in with your pair and make sure you're both on the same page.</p><br>
        <p>The best (and most humbling) part about pair programming is gaining access to a different learning style, and mostly, a different approach to a problem. I've thought so many times, "Wow. I wouldn't have thought about it that way!" In this regard, it's a really great way to learn. Your method is one of many, many methods. Two minds are better than one.</p><br>

        <p>One thing I've really had trouble with is feeling distracted. I'm so used to working alone. I have a tough time concentrating with the pressure of someone being on the receiving end sometimes. "Wait, say that again?"" I think this will get better once I get onsite, mostly because the nuances of being in the same space physically lends itself to more clarity and focus, perhaps.</p><br>

        <h5>Getting feedback</h5><br>
        <p>Mostly, my feedback has been really positive. It was a huge relief knowing I'm doing okay and communicating well! Kinda like: </p><br>

        <p>Update: I've received a criticism, thankfully. And it is something I have already pointed out within myself.<strike>I haven't really received any criticisms, which is both awesome and unnerving at the same time. Mostly unnerving. I know they're going to come pouring in at some point. So I'm just going to relish in the positivity for now and prepare myself for being vulnerable onsite.</strike></p><br>
        <p>Personally, I know there are things I need to work on:<br><br>
          <div class="strategies">
          <ol>
            <li>- Work more on explaining myself while working through a problem a little better</li><br>
            <li>- Stop being afraid of taking more initiative for fear of appearing "pushy." If I know about something, I should feel comfortable admitting it, rather than dumbing myself down!</li><br>
            <li>- Ask more questions when not understanding pair's thought process</li><br>
            <li>- Trust in myself and in my partner. We will get through it!</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
          <br>
          <p>Writing feedback for the pairs I didn't have stellar sessions with was difficult. How do you criticize someone kindly? It's hard to give criticism at all when people are giving their best effort. But I keep in mind, the criticism is for their own good. In this process, it's all about helping others and helping others help you.</p>
