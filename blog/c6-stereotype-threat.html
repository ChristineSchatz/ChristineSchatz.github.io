        <h4>Fighting Stereotype Threat</h4>
        <h5>Being a woman in engineering</h5>
        <p id="date">April 6, 2015</p><br>
        <p><span class="emphasis">"If you're trying to perform in an area where your group is negatively stereotyped, you're going to feel extra pressure, a distracting kind of pressure, and this pressure can affect the way you perform."</span> - Claude Steele</p><br>
        <img src="../blog_photos/math_stereotype.png" /><br>
        <p>"Stereotype threat" is a situational predicament in which people are or feel themselves to be at risk of confirming negative stereotypes about their social group. It's a socio-psychological theory developed by Claude Steele and Joshua Aronson. What makes us vulnerable to "stereotype threat?" Perhaps it's caring too much about doing well in a certain situation in order to ward off negative stereotypes. The effort & attention one puts on thwarting these stereotypes can negatively affect intellectual performance. It becomes something of a self-fulfilling prophecy.</p><br>
        <p>
          In <span class="emphasis">one of my computer science classes</span>, I was the only female in a class of 20 students. My grade in this particular class happened to be the lowest grade I've ever gotten (my only non-<span class="emphasis">"A"</span> grade. There I go trying to prove myself to you that I'm a girl and I'm smart and I "can do this."). The material WAS difficult and my professor was a tough grader, so I don't know if this proves Steele's theory true, but it sure was a funny coincidence.</p><br>
          <p>On <span class="emphasis">racial identity:</span> I am half-Asian. Although I was raised mostly by my Asian mother and identify with being Asian, I don't feel the pressure to live up to "Asian good at math" standards that Asians are typically plagued by, mostly because I don't think most people perceive me as Asian. Some people can "totally tell", but most assume I'm white, which is also weird, because I really identify with being Asian. I think that's a blog post for another day, perhaps.

        <h5>On DJing and the music industry</h5><br>
        <p>When I was a DJ, I remember hearing someone ask about my skills: "Is she good, or is she <span class="emphasis">GIRL good?</span>" When auditioning my demo mixtape to a semi-famous (male, obvs) DJ: "Wait, YOU made this?" A male promoter: "You need to show more skin." Again and again and again. I eventually grew tired of the entertainment crowd and stopped DJing altogether. Did I stop solely because of the stereotype bullshit? Not entirely, but that was one of many reasons. Most of my DJ friends were on the path to becoming Vegas and big club DJs, which is the only path you could really take if you depended on it financially. I was simply nauseated by all of it. What started as a bedroom hobby turned into a period of disillusionment, isolation, and not feeling true to myself.</p><br>

        <p>.</p>

        <p>I still channel my love of music through other means, one of which is my music blog. I was so excited when it was added to <span class="emphasis">Hype Machine</span>'s master list, but then I saw a tag on my blog's main profile: #FemaleBlogger. How about just <span class="emphasis">music blogger</span>? Why can't my blog be measured by the same standards as other blogs? Do women have certain genres of music they write about exclusively?</p><br>
        <p>I feel the same apprehension in regards to being a "woman in tech." Will we eventually be perceived as "software engineers" instead of <a href="https://medium.com/@amyngyn/i-need-terrible-female-engineers-1023a2e973dd">women software engineers</a>?" It's a difficult issue, and one that has no easy answers. I think it's great that DBC is making members of dominant groups aware of this issue. Thanks for reading!</p>
