        <h4>Having fun with Classes</h4>
        <h5>Let's create a dog!</h5>
        <p id="date">May 9, 2015</p><br>
        <p>Learning classes is essential for any object-oriented progammer. Classes are like blueprints. It's their job to encapsulate data and the behaviors that will act on that data. I'm going to use an example that I think can illustrate the concept of a class in a simple way. We're going to make a class called <span class="emphasis">Frenchie</span>. I'm not a crazy dog person or anything like that, but I happen to be a fan of French bulldogs.
        </p><br>
        <p>Creating a class is as simple as:</p><br>
          <img src="../blog_photos/class_ex.png" />
          <br>
        <p>In order for your program to know about a <span class="emphasis">Frenchie</span> object, we need to create an initialize method into which we'll pass in data about a particular French bulldog. Your initialize method holds this data in instance variables, which are preceded by an @ symbol. Let's take a look:</p><br>
        <img src="../blog_photos/class_ex2.png" /><br>
        <p>Ruby has some convenient built-in ways for you to access and change this data. They are called <span class="emphasis">attr_reader, attr_writer, attr_accessor.</span> With our example, we want to make :name, :age, and :gender accessible through <span class="emphasis">attr_reader</span>, which simply allows you to see the data, not change it. <span class="emphasis">attr_writer</span> allows you to change data, and <span class="emphasis">attr_accessor</span> allows you to do both. We'll make our age and weight both accessible and readable, since these can change over time, whereas the others can't (unless you rename your dog, which would be weird). This is how you do it:</p><br>
        <img src="../blog_photos/class_ex3.png" /><br>

        <p>Now let's do something fun with our data! We'll create a method to print out our Frenchie stats. And all we have to do to access what's in our instance variables is reference our attr_ methods by putting them inside interpolation brackets!:</p><br>
        <img src="../blog_photos/class_ex4.png" /><br>
        <p>Notice above that we can call methods from other methods! Our <span class="emphasis">young_old</span> method determines whether or not your Frenchie is young, kinda old, or really old depending on his age. These numbers are somewhat specific to this breed. If we had a <span class="emphasis">Labrador</span> class, for example, our numbers might be different. Technically, we could have had a <span class="emphasis">Dog</span> class from which class breeds inherit from, and they could have customized methods for breed-specific data. But anyway, let's get onto to instantiating our <span class="emphasis">Frenchie</span>!</p><br>
        <img src="../blog_photos/class_ex5.png" /><br>
        <p>Here's what will output:</p><br>
        <img src="../blog_photos/class_ex6.png" /><br>
        <p>All that data just from calling our method <span class="emphasis">show</span> on our dog! And also see that we can access its age just by calling <span class="emphasis">.age</span> on the object. That's it for now. Hope you enjoyed my post. Thanks for reading!
