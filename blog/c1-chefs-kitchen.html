        <h5>The Dev Bootcamp Experience</h5>
        <p id="date">April 11, 2015</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          After watching Shereef's Fireside Chat video, I feel ready and excited
          about Dev Bootcamp. I'm going into this knowing it's not going to be
          easy, and that I'm going to learn a lot about myself, both good and
          bad. It's going to be up to me to take charge of my learning
          environment.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Dev Bootcamp is not the type of program that will give you "fast
          results." You will get out of the program only what you put into it.
          You have to be comfortable not knowing anything, ask for help when
          needed, and willing to take intitiave in your own learning. I've never
          been exposed to pair programming before, and I'm a little nervous
          about it. I'm pretty used to working alone, and sharing that control
          will take some getting used to. We have to be both teacher and
          learner. Software development is a team sport, and the immersion
          experience will very much be about that.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I also really like that Dev Bootcamp emphasizes the mind and body.
          I've read books by Alan Watts and Thich Nhat Hanh, but I've always
          failed at incorporating meditation into my daily life. Dev Bootcamp
          will be the best excuse to try and start again! I have so many
          thoughts running through my mind all the time, and it's going to be
          important to open up space in there. I'm super excited to get to know
          my cohort and start this journey! Til next time. Thanks for reading.
