        <h4>Dealing with Conflict </h4>
        <h5>Identifying the roots of emotion</h5>
        <p id="date">May 31, 2015</p>
        <br>
        <p>This week we're discussing a situation in which we've experienced conflict and how it was resolved.
        </p><br>

        <p>My most recent, and rather unpleasant, experiences with conflict involved an argument I had with my husband's friends, both of whom were both humanities professors. (My husband is a professor in the humanities, so naturally, a lot of our meetups are with professors from the humanities as well (modern languages, philosophy, literature, law, anthropology, etc. I actually have a BA degree in a humanities discipline, so I have nothing against the humanities!) It started out with one of them criticizing economics as a major, dismissing it as "boring" and "useless." I became really defensive, and somehow our discussion on the job prospects of specific majors escalated into an argument. One of them claimed that it's really easy for humanities majors to find stable, well-paying jobs. While this is sometimes true, it's still not always the case. I told him that engineering and economics majors have better chances of finding stable jobs, and he thoroughly disagreed. No matter how much I backed up my perspective with concrete examples, he just wouldn't agree to disagree. It didn't help that his tone was really aggressive.</p>
        <br>
        <p>What did I learn from this? We're all entitled to our own perspective. We all have a different set of experiences that make us who we are. It turns out this professor felt so strongly about opportunities being great for students in the U.S. regardless of their major because he's from Spain, where the unemployment rate still hovers around 24%.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In a perfect world, students could pursue their "passion" and make a living from it. I do think it's easier to do this in the U.S. than in other countries. So when he mentioned his former situation in Spain, I felt bad and told him I understood where he was coming from. I think most conflict can be avoided with good communication. Had he mentioned Spain at the beginning of the conversation, it would have probably turned out differently. But generally, I learned that even though you disagree with someone's perspective, it's best to give them the benefit of the doubt.
