        <h4>Enumerables</h4>
        <h5>The Map method</h5>
        <p id="date">May 3, 2015</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The <span class="emphasis">Enumerable</span> module in Ruby is
          probably the reason a lot of Ruby developers don't rely on
          conventional for loops much. They provide really convenient ways to
          traverse, search, sort, and manipulate collections. Here, I'm going to
          look at the <span class="emphasis">map</span> method. The map method
          executes a given block for each element of an array or hash, and will
          actually return a new array. It will not, however, manipulate the
          original array unless you use <span class="emphasis">map!</span>,
          which indicates it's destructible (we won't get into that for now).
          I'll demonstrate two use examples.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          Example 1: Let's say we have a hash called
          <span class="emphasis">artists</span> and we wanted to print out all
          the artists whose genre is "hip hop." You would use the following
          block to iterate through your hash with the desired results:
        </p>
        <br />

        <img src="../blog_photos/mapexample2.png" />
        <br /><br />
        <p>
          Not only will our map example here print the artists who correspond to
          hip hop, but it will also return a new array of what was executed from
          the block, hence the returned array of:
          <span class="emphasis"
            ># => [nil, nil, "Gangstarr", nil, nil, "Quasimoto", nil]</span
          >. Pretty cool, huh? The each method will do the same thing, but it
          will return the original array (or hash).
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          Example 2: Another use of map involves simple operations. I was
          inspired by a fun example using food and calories. I modified mine for
          desserts and grams of sugar. We can use
          <span class="emphasis">map</span> to divide each value in half, where
          the key is the dessert, and the value is the amount of sugar in grams.
          Check it out:
        </p>
        <br />

        <img src="../blog_photos/mapexample3.png" />
        <br /><br />
        <p>
          This example returned an array containing a set of two-item arrays,
          each of which corresponded to the key/value pair in our grams_sugar
          hash.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>That's all for now. Hope you learned something! :-)</p>
