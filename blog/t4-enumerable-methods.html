        <h4>Enumerables</h4>
        <h5>The Map method</h5>
        <p id="date">May 3, 2015</p><br>
        <p> The <span class="emphasis">Enumerable</span> module in Ruby is probably the reason a lot of Ruby developers don't rely on the for loop much. I'm pretty accustomed to using the for loop, and this is why I still get thrown for a loop (sorry) with enumerables. But I'm learning to love them! They provide really convenient ways to traverse, search, sort, and manipulate collections. Here, I'm going to look at the <span class="emphasis">map</span> method. The map method executes a given block for each element of an array or hash, and will actually return a new array. It will not, however, manipulate the original array unless you use <span class="emphasis">map!</span>, which indicates it's destructible (we won't get into that for now). I'll demonstrate two use examples.
        </p><br>

        <p>Example 1: Let's say we have a hash called <span class="emphasis">artists</span> and we wanted to print out all the artists whose genre is "hip hop." You would use the following block to iterate through your hash with the desired results:</p><br>

        <img src="../blog_photos/mapexample2.png" />
        <br><br>
        <p>Not only will our map example here print the artists who correspond to hip
          hop, but it will also return a new array of what was executed from the block, hence
          the returned array of: <span class="emphasis"># => [nil, nil, "Gangstarr", nil, nil, "Quasimoto", nil]</span>. Pretty cool, huh? The each method will do the same thing, but it will return the original array (or hash).
        </p><br>

        <p>Example 2: Another use of map involves simple operations. I was inspired by a
          fun example using food and calories. I modified mine for desserts and grams of
          sugar. We can use <span class="emphasis">map</span> to divide each value in half, where the key is the dessert,
          and the value is the amount of sugar in grams. Check it out:
        </p><br>

        <img src="../blog_photos/mapexample3.png" />
        <br><br>
        <p>This example returned an array containing a set of two-item arrays, each of
          which corresponded to the key/value pair in our grams_sugar hash.</p><br>
        <p>That's all for now. Hope you learned something! :-)
