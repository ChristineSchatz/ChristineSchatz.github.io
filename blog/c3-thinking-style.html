        <h4>My Thinking-Learning Style</h4>
        <h5>Learning How I Learn</h5>
        <p id="date">April 26, 2015</p>
        <br>
        <p>My Gregorc Thinking Style test results turned out as follows:</p><br>
          <ol>
            <li>Concrete Sequential (tied)</li>
            <li>Concrete Random (tied)</li>
            <li>Abstract Random</li>
            <li>Abstract Sequential</li>
          </ol><br>

        <p>I think it makes sense that I was tied between the two concrete thinking styles, but after reading more about each, I feel more aligned with the Concrete Random style. This is absolutely and completely true of my learning style:</p><br>

        <p><strong>** They learn best when they are able to use trial-and-error approaches and given the opportunity to work through the problems themselves. They like experimenting to find answers and solving problems independently.**</strong></p><br>

        <p>So far, my biggest struggles relate to pairing: keeping focused and not knowing whether or not I'm doing a good job of driving or navigating. Sometimes while pairing, my thoughts trail off a little, or I might focus on the character of my pair's voice, or what's going on in their background, or something abstract and weird, and I have to consciously check in to keep focused on the solution. I think pairing is naturally going to be a struggle for a lot of students. We've never had experience with it before, and it requires a degree of relinquishing control. And relinquishing control is probably hard for Conrete Random & Sequential thinkers.
        </p><br>

        <p>That being said, I think I need to work on is being a little more vocal about how I learn best to my pair. Instead of struggling with a solution, and saying "Umm...uhhh, hmm...lemme think," I could say, "Hey ____, do you mind if I experiment a little and try a couple of my ideas out? I just want to see if it would work."
        </p><br>
        <p>I also need to work on analyzing problems before trying to solve them. It's not intuitive to pseudocode, but I really need to try and pseudocode out harder challenges every single time. My instinct is often to dive right into a problem, which is not a good practice.</p><br>
        <p>Thanks for reading!</p>
