        <h4>Asking good questions</h4>
        <h5>For when you need HELP!</h5>
        <p id="date">June 7, 2015</p>
        <br>
        <p>Getting stuck on a problem is inevitable. Every software developer has had to ask questions at some point or another! It's important to ask good questions in order to get the help you need.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>I haven't asked too many questions on Stack Overflow because 98% of the time, someone has already asked the same question. </p>
        <br>
        <p>But if you're going to take the SO plunge, here's some tips on how to ask good questions, culled from SO and <a href="http://codeblog.jonskeet.uk/2010/08/29/writing-the-perfect-question/" target="_blank">Jon Skeet's coding blog</a>.</p><br>
        <div class="blog_list">
        <ol>
          <li>If your post needs a title, make the title as specific as possible. The title is one of the most eye-catching aspects of a question.</li>
          <li>Make the first paragraph in your post concise and explicative of your problem. This is the most-read portion of question's content.</li>
          <li>Include relevant tags</li>
          <li>Proof-read your question</li>
          <li>Imagine you are to answer the question. What's being asked? If you were coming into the question without any context, would you potentially be able to understand what's going on?</li>
          <li>Describe what you've already tried in order to solve the problem.</li>
          <li>Again: <span class="emphasis">make sure it's clear what you are trying to accomplish</span>! What's your input, and what's your intended output?</li>
        </ol><br>

      </div>
        <br>
        <p>I hope that helps! I know Stack Overflow can be really intimidating. Once your question gets an up-vote (or even better, once your first answer has been up-voted!), you'll feel like this: </p>
