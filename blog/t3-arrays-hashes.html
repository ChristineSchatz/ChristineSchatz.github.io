        <h4>Arrays vs Hashes</h4>
        <h5>When to use each</h5>
        <p id="date">April 25, 2015</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Arrays are ordered collections of objects, be it strings, numbers, or
          arrays themselves! Hashes are collections, too, but they're unordered
          and utilize key-value pairs.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          In Ruby, you can initialize arrays with the new method or implicitly,
          by populating them
        </p>
        <br />
        <pre>ingredients = Array.new</pre>
        <pre>
ingredients = ["shrimp", "cumin", "chicken", "avocado", "cilantro"]</pre
        >
        <pre>
players = ["Joakim Noah", "Nate Robinson", "Tim Duncan", "Paul Pierce"]</pre
        >
        <br />
        <p>
          Arrays are indexed by integers, starting at 0. If you wanted to access
          "Nate Robinson" from the players array, you would do it like so:
        </p>
        <br />
        <pre>players[1]</pre>
        <br />
        <p>
          Ruby has really convenient class methods for Arrays. You can access
          the first or last element of an array easily by calling
          <strong
            >(whatever's after the # symbol is just a comment in Ruby. I just
            want to show you what will be returned from the method):</strong
          >
        </p>
        <br />
        <pre>ingredients.first #=> "shrimp" </pre>
        <pre>ingredients.last #=> "cilantro" </pre>
        <br />
        <p>You can even return the first n elements of an array:</p>
        <br />
        <pre>ingredients.take(2) #=> ["shrimp", "cumin"]</pre>
        <br />
        <p>Arrays can also be counted easily or checked for emptiness by:</p>
        <br />
        <pre>ingredients.length #=> 5</pre>
        <pre>ingredients.count #=> 5</pre>
        <pre>ingredients.empty? #=> false</pre>
        <br />

        <p>
          Let's move on to hashes for now. While arrays are awesome at keeping
          your elements organized, hashes are great for a different type of
          organization. Instead of using integers to access your values, you can
          use any object type to do so. For example, let's initialize a hash
          called population. We'll initialize it implicitly, without the "new"
          keyword.
        </p>
        <br />
        <pre>population = {"Tiny Farm Town" => 1,000, "Suburban" => 20,000, <br>"Gentrified Brooklyn" => 1,000,000}</pre>
        <br />
        <p>
          You can also use what are called symbols as the keys. Symbols are
          preceded with a colon. You still use "#=>" to point to your value,
          like so:
        </p>
        <br />
        <pre>population = { :tiny_farm => 1,000}</pre>
        <br />
        <p>Or you can do this and forget about the "=>":</p>
        <br />
        <pre>population = { tiny_farm: 1000, suburban: 20,000, gentrified_brooklyn:<br>1,000,000}</pre>
        <br />
        <p>You can populate a Hash differently, one by one, like this:</p>
        <br />
        <pre>cities = {}<br>cities[:san_diego] = "college"<br>cities[:los_angeles] = "home"</pre>
        <br />
        <p>
          You can use hashes as named parameters in a method. This might be
          beyond the scope of this beginner post, but I thought it was pretty
          cool:
        </p>
        <br />
        <pre>Employee.create(name: "Blake Griffin", age: 25)</pre>
        <br />
        <p>
          I think that's all I have for now. Til next time! Thanks for reading.
