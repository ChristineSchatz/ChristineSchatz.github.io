        <h4>Diversity in Tech</h4>
        <h5>The racial divide</h5>
        <p id="date">May 3, 2015</p><br>
        <img src="../blog_photos/hackforla.jpg" /><br>
        <p>Gender diversity in tech has been a hot topic for a few years now, but I don't
          think racial diversity in tech has been focused on nearly as much.
        </p><br>

        <p>According to The Verge, blacks hold only 1% of technology jobs at AirBnB. Nationally, black and Hispanic workers make up just 12 and 16% of the US workforce. I think the lack of racial diversity in tech is a problem tied to a greater issue: the oppressive socio-political structures that have shaped our society. There are a myriad of consequences from these socio-political structures: crumbling educational systems, low opportunity, class isolation, crime and violence. Even cultural and societal segregation. How many kids from low-income families do you think have future opportunities to study computer science? How many have heard of it? Studying computer science is a privilege that should belong to everyone, regardless of class or race.</p><br>

        <p>As a half-Filipino, I am also aware that Asian-Americans are classified as "more privileged" than other minority groups. They are often stereotyped as straight-A, perfectionist students. While it's true that you might see more Chinese, Korean, and Indian students than other minority groups in computer science programs, it's not necessarily the case for Chinese-American, Vietnamese-American, or Korean-American students. Or what about Americans with Cambodian, Laotian, and Indonesian backgrounds? Do you think they all come from upper-class families? It's a tough thing to write about because there really isn't a lot of data out there. We are prone to making dangerous assumptions, or accepting the status-quo.</p><br>

        <p>In conclusion, I think the best we can do is support organizations that help low-opportunity students break into the industry. Some of them are listed below. Please donate. They are awesome! </p>
