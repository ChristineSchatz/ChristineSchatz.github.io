        <h4>Diversity in Tech</h4>
        <h5>The racial divide</h5>
        <p id="date">May 3, 2015</p>
        <br />

        <p>
          Gender diversity in tech has been a hot topic for a few years now, but
          I don't think racial diversity in tech has been focused on nearly as
          much.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          According to The Verge, blacks hold only 1% of technology jobs at
          AirBnB. Nationally, black and Hispanic workers make up just 12 and 16%
          of the US workforce. I think the lack of racial diversity in tech is a
          problem tied to a greater issue: the oppressive socio-political
          structures that have shaped our society. There are a myriad of
          consequences from these socio-political structures: crumbling
          educational systems, low opportunity, class isolation, crime and
          violence. Even cultural and societal segregation. How many kids from
          low-income families do you think have future opportunities to study
          computer science? How many have heard of it? Studying computer science
          is a privilege that should belong to everyone, regardless of class or
          race.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          As a half-Filipino, I am also aware that Asian-Americans are
          classified as "more privileged" than other minority groups. They are
          often stereotyped as straight-A, perfectionist students. While it's
          true that you might see more Chinese, Korean, and Indian students than
          other minority groups in computer science programs, it's not
          necessarily the case for Chinese-American, Vietnamese-American, or
          Korean-American students. Or what about Americans with Cambodian,
          Laotian, and Indonesian backgrounds? Do you think they all come from
          upper-class families? It's a tough thing to write about because there
          really isn't a lot of data out there. We are prone to making dangerous
          assumptions, or accepting the status-quo.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          In conclusion, I think the best we can do is support organizations
          that help low-opportunity students break into the industry. Some of
          them are listed below. Please donate. They are awesome!
