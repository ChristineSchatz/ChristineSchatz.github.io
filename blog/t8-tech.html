        <h4>Regular Expressions</h4>
        <h5>aka "regex"</h5>
        <p id="date">May 31, 2015</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I've been interested in Regular Expressions for a while now,
          especially since I've always seen them used frequently in solutions on
          Stack Overflow. Very briefly defined, a
          <span class="emphasis">regular expression</span> is a sequence of
          characters that defines a search pattern. You'll see them used mostly
          for string matching.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          If you've ever seen anything like this:
          <span class="emphasis"
            >\b[A-Z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z]{2,4}\b</span
          >, it can look pretty intimidating! But I'll try to break it down with
          some simple examples sourced from a couple great websites.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          Firstly, it's VERY important to know what the symbols of regex stand
          for. Jeffrey Way of Tuts Plus suggests memorizing them. No other way
          around it:
        </p>
        <br />

        <ul>
          <li class="list">. - Matches any character, except newline.</li>
          <li class="list">
            * - Matches 0 or more of the preceding character.
          </li>
          <li class="list">
            + - Matches 1 or more of the preceding character.
          </li>
          <li class="list">
            ? - Preceding character is optional. Matches 0 or 1 occurrence.
          </li>
          <li class="list">\d - Matches any single digit</li>
          <li class="list">
            \w - Matches any word character (alphanumeric & underscore).
          </li>
          <li class="list">
            [XYZ] - Matches any single character from the character class.
          </li>
          <li class="list">
            [XYZ]+ - Matches one or more of any of the characters in the set.
          </li>
          <li class="list">$ - Matches the end of the string.</li>
          <li class="list">^ - Matches the beginning of a string.</li>
          <li class="list">
            [^a-z] - When inside of a character class, the ^ means NOT; in this
            case, match anything that is NOT a lowercase letter.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Let's start with a really simple example. Here, we are looking for the
          word "ruby" in the phrase on the right side of the =~ operator. If
          found, it returns the index where the first instance is found. You can
          also use .match() in place of =~.
        </p>
        <br />
        <pre>/ruby/ =~ "I'm using Ruby!" #=> 8</pre>
        <pre>/costa rica/.match("We're going to New York.") #=> nil</pre>
        <pre>/st/.match('haystack') #=> "st"</pre>
        <br />

        <p>
          Now things get a little trickier. Let's look at an example using regex
          match and replace. I found an excellent example from the lovely Liz
          Abanante's blog! We want to separate an integer with commas every 3rd
          integer, so that 100000 would output to 100,000. [This is one of the
          challenges we were given!]
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Let's say Liz has a method called separate_comma, and it could look
          like this:
        </p>
        <br />
        <pre>
          def separate_comma(number)
            comma_num = number.to_s
            comma_num.reverse.gsub(/...(?=.)/, '\&,').reverse
          end
           </pre
        >
        <br />
        <p>
          How does this work? Well, firstly, gsub means global substitution. It
          takes two arguments, the first of which is our match, and the second
          is what we want to replace that with. The . (period) in regex can mean
          anything! So:
        </p>
        <br />
        <pre>
          num.reverse.gsub(/...
        </pre>
        <br />
        <p>
          calls for 3 consecutive "anything" characters. It then uses the (?=.)
          expression to *find* these anything characters. We then substitute
          /...(?=.)/ with a comma: '\&,' (\& is the matched text!)
        </p>
        <p>
          Hope that made sense! For more examples, see Ruby's official docs:

        </p>

        <p>That's it for now! Thanks for reading.</p>
