      Phew! I can't believe Week 1 is already coming to a close. This week's curriculum gave us lots of opportunity to practice using Git and GitHub. So what is Git, and what is GitHub? Git is a version control tool you use on your local machine to keep track of your files and the changes you make to them. GitHub is a website where you can add these tracked files and collaborate with others.

      Version control refers to exactly that - control over different versions of your files. When you save a change to your file, you save them as a commit. Let's say you're working on a file, a recipe called applepie.txt. But it turns out you want two different versions of this recipe. The one with crumble on top already exists. But you want one with less of the crumble, something more traditional. You can actually use git to go back to your most recent commit, or save, and create a new branch. From this branch, you can make your crumble delete, save the commit, and voila. Now you have two different working versions of your applepie.txt. At any point in time, you can delete the branch you created. Though, it's probably better to merge into your main branch, or master branch, if you decide to scrap your changes. A "merge conflict" may arise, in which case you would manually edit your changes and save the commit. Version control is also a safety net of sorts. What if you make a change that breaks your code, but you already saved your file? Version control allows you to go back to the save, and correct your mistake.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you're working with others, or just want your files or code to be on the Internet, you can do what's called a "git push" to GitHub. There, you could keep your "master" branch, which has all your final edits. GitHub is an incredible tool for collaboration in that it eliminates the need for sending files back and forth. A team of programmers can work on a project simultaneously, pushing their edits to GitHub, and have them "merged" to the master branch through a special request called a pull request. A pull request is basically a way of saying, "Hey, I made this change. Please take a look at it and let me know if you approve. If you do, please merge it!"
    </p>

       Git and GitHub are powerful tools programmers can use to make your work environment more efficient, smoother, and just...more fun!
