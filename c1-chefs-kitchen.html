    After watching Shereef's Fireside Chat video, I feel ready and excited about Dev Bootcamp. I know it's not going to be an easy experience, and it's going to make me learn a lot about myself, good and bad. It's going to be up to me to take charge of my learning environment.

    My fears are mostly based around inadequacy. I'm currently completing a degree in computer science from a community college. I sometimes feel like I still know nothing. I have this fear that by the end of the program (assuming I get there!), I won't have all the tools I need to ace the technical interview. I'm terrified of the technical interview. I tend to go blank in nerve-wrecking situations. It's up to me to take better control of my mind, to shift into a growth-mindset, and embrace my fears and just work through them. I need to stop worrying about the outcome, and just let go of my anxiety.

    At the end of the day, though, I do feel like I have the personality and grit to get through Dev Bootcamp. It's just really important to believe in yourself, as cliche as it sounds. I really like that Dev Bootcamp emphasizes the mind and body. I used to read books by Alan Watts and Thich Nhat Hanh. I always failed at incorporating meditation into my daily life. But DBC will be the best excuse to try and start again! I'm really excited to get to know my cohort and start this journey! Til next time. Thanks for reading.
