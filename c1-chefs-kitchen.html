    After watching Shereef's Fireside Chat video, I feel ready and excited about Dev Bootcamp. I'm going into this knowing it's not going to be easy, and that I'm going to learn a lot about myself, both good and bad. It's going to be up to me to take charge of my learning environment.

    Dev Bootcamp is not the type of program that will give you "fast results." You will get out of the program only what you put into it. You have to be comfortable not knowing anything, ask for help when needed, and willing to take intitiave in your own learning. I've never been exposed to pair programming before, and I'm a little nervous about it. I'm pretty used to working alone, and sharing that control will take some getting used to. We have to be both teacher and learner. Software development is a team sport, and the immersion experience will very much be about that.

    I also really like that Dev Bootcamp emphasizes the mind and body. I've read books by Alan Watts and Thich Nhat Hanh, but I've always failed at incorporating meditation into my daily life. Dev Bootcamp will be the best excuse to try and start again! I have so many thoughts running through my mind all the time, and it's going to be important to open up space in there. I'm super excited to get to know my cohort and start this journey! Til next time. Thanks for reading.
